Certainly! To add a documentation file with setup and installation instructions to your code folder, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in your code folder and name it something like "SETUP.md" or "INSTALLATION.md". The ".md" extension indicates that it's a Markdown file, which is a common format for documentation.

2. Open the newly created file in a text editor.

3. Write your setup and installation instructions in the file using Markdown syntax. Here's an example of what the content might look like:

   ```markdown
   # Setup and Installation

   This document provides instructions on how to set up and install the Expense Splitting API project.

   ## Prerequisites

   Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

   - Node.js (version X.X.X)
   - MongoDB (version X.X.X)

   ## Installation Steps

   1. Clone the repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/sk230144/userexpenses.git
      ```

   2. Navigate to the project directory:
      ```
      cd expense-splitting-api
      ```

   3. Install the dependencies:
      ```
      npm install
      ```

   4. Set up the MongoDB connection:
      - Open the `server.js` file.
      - Replace the `mongoURI` variable with your MongoDB connection URL.

   5. Start the server:
      ```
      node server.js
      ```

      The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

   ## Configuration

   The project uses the following configuration variables:

   - `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run (default: 3000).
   - `mongoURI`: The MongoDB connection URL.

   You can modify these variables in the `server.js` file if needed.

   ## Troubleshooting

   If you encounter any issues during the setup or installation process, please try the following:

   - Double-check that you have installed all the prerequisites correctly.
   - Ensure that you have replaced the `mongoURI` variable with your actual MongoDB connection URL.
   - Verify that you have run the `npm install` command to install all the necessary dependencies.

   If the issue persists, please feel free to contact our support team at [support@expensesplitting.com](mailto:support@expensesplitting.com) for further assistance.

   ```

   Feel free to customize the content based on your specific project requirements and add any additional sections or instructions that you think would be helpful for users.

4. Save the file.

Now you have a documentation file named "SETUP.md" or "INSTALLATION.md" in your code folder that contains the setup and installation instructions for your project.

You can also include this file in your version control system (e.g., Git) so that it can be easily accessed by other developers or users who want to set up and run your project.

Remember to keep the documentation up to date as your project evolves, and consider adding more sections or files to cover different aspects of your project, such as usage guidelines, API documentation, or troubleshooting tips.
