# Expense Splitting API

This is an API for splitting expenses among users. It allows users to create expenses, retrieve individual and overall expenses, and download a balance sheet.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 
- MongoDB
- Postman (or any other API testing tool)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-splitting-api.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the MongoDB connection:
   - Open the `server.js` file.
   - Replace the `mongoURI` variable with your MongoDB connection URL.

4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

    ]
  }
  ```
- Response: Created expense object

### Retrieve Individual User Expenses

- URL: `GET /users/:userId/expenses`
- Response: Array of expenses where the user is a participant

### Retrieve Overall Expenses

- URL: `GET /expenses`
- Query Parameters:
  - `splitMethod`: Filter expenses by split method (e.g., `Equal`, `Exact`, `Percentage`)
  - `sort`: Sort expenses by a specific field (e.g., `totalAmount`, `-createdAt`)
  - `participant`: Filter expenses by participant's user ID
  - `paidBy`: Filter expenses by the payer's user ID
- Response: Array of expenses matching the filter criteria

### Download Balance Sheet

- URL: `GET /balance-sheet`
- Response: Downloadable CSV file containing the balance sheet data

## Testing with Postman

1. Open Postman and create a new request.

2. Set the request method (GET, POST) and enter the appropriate URL for the API endpoint you want to test.

3. If required, provide the necessary request body or query parameters.

4. Click on the "Send" button to send the request to the server.

5. Check the response body and status code to verify the API endpoint's behavior.

6. Repeat the steps for each API endpoint you want to test.

## Example Test Cases

Here are some example test cases you can use to verify the functionality of the API endpoints:

1. Create User:
   - Send a POST request to `/users` with a valid request body.
   - Verify that the response contains the created user object.

2. Retrieve User Details:
   - Send a GET request to `/users/:userId` with a valid user ID.
   - Verify that the response contains the user object.

3. Add Expense (Equal Split):
   - Send a POST request to `/expenses` with a valid request body for an equal split expense.
   - Verify that the response contains the created expense object.

4. Add Expense (Exact Split):
   - Send a POST request to `/expenses` with a valid request body for an exact split expense.
   - Verify that the response contains the created expense object.

5. Add Expense (Percentage Split):
   - Send a POST request to `/expenses` with a valid request body for a percentage split expense.
   - Verify that the response contains the created expense object.

6. Retrieve Individual User Expenses:
   - Send a GET request to `/users/:userId/expenses` with a valid user ID.
   - Verify that the response contains an array of expenses where the user is a participant.

7. Retrieve Overall Expenses:
   - Send a GET request to `/expenses` with different query parameters to filter and sort expenses.
   - Verify that the response contains an array of expenses matching the filter criteria.

8. Download Balance Sheet:
   - Send a GET request to `/balance-sheet`.
   - Verify that the response is a downloadable CSV file containing the balance sheet data.
